# Active Directory Hacking Lab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

This Active Directory Hacking lab project will include implementation of an AD environment (with 1 DC with 2 computers connected with it in a domain) as well as pushing logs from the DC to my own Elastic SIEM. Also, I have planned to do some attacks and try to write detection logics (in KQL and EQL) to detect AD attacks.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
